### Project Motivation
For this project I was interested in predicting short-term (1 day) price trend on ADA-Carado Cryptocurrency

The project involved:
 - Loading and cleaning de data from investing.com
 - Conducting Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the data and relevant Features
 - Feature Engineering to build usefull new features to the model.
 - Modelling using machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest and XGBoost.

### Result Summary
Based on the results and metrics the performance of the model wasnÂ´t as good as expected. However, we obtained better results than an aleatory choice. It is clear that prediction prices and trends in crypto and stock market will continue to be a hot topic as there is a lot to improve and explore.

A Xgboost t Classifier was chosen to be the best model. The final model achieved and Accuracy score of 0.59 and a F1_score of 0.66.
