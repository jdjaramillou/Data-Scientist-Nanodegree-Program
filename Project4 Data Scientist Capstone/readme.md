### Introduction
in this project I explore the historical prices of bitcoin fromo January 2017 to Octuber 2021. The historical data was downloaded from investing.com [website](https://www.investing.com/indices/investing.com-btc-usd). This data contains among other information regarding daily closing prices, volume traded and daily price change.

For this analysis, I focused in answering these three questions:
1. How volatile is bitcoin?
2. Were certain months better or worse for Bitcoin?
3. Are Bitcoin and Ethereum prices or volatilities releated ?

### Result Summary
There are some takeaways that I got from analyzing the data:
* Bitcoin has been an extremely volatile assets and investor willing to trade this assets will bear a high risk. 
* Based on historical data, Bitcoin has had negative returns on September and on April and October has had good price rallies.
* Bitcoin and Ethereumare different crypto currencies with different objectives and projects, however their returns and prices have had a high degree of relationship.
